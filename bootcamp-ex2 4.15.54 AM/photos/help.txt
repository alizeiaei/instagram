Happy Sunday Devs! 👋

I haven’t been active on instagram recently, trying to juggle work commitments, personal life, social life had resulted in me suffering from some burn out. I have since taken some time away, but I am back and ready to get back to creating content again! 🙏

Burnout is definitely one of they things I have seen other people experience but just assumed it wouldn’t happen to me! (Naive, I know!). 🙃

I have introduced some new habits and I’ve got a new routine - which I’m happy to share if anyone needs some tips! But, incase someone hasn’t it recently! It’s ok to take time to look after yourself, and please do!! ❤️

I hope you all have a great weekend! And are ready to get started tomorrow for another week - get out and smash it!👊.

Happy Hump Day folks

Half way through the week already, how’s it going for you? Are you making it count?

Make some more progress on the workout app hopefully be looking for some people who want to test it out soon and provide some feedback for new features/bugs etc!

Keep it moving folks 👊🏼 🚀
